## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to develop a logistic regression machine learning model and review the predictions for the lending data. This will identify risk associated with lending to different borrowers and help lenders make decisions and minimize financial loss.

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
    * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
