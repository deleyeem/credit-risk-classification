## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to develop a logistic regression machine learning model and review the predictions for the lending data. This will identify risk associated with lending to different borrowers and help lenders make decisions and minimize financial loss.

## Results
** Accuracy: 0.99
    ** the model is 99% accurate in predicting healthy and high-rsik loans.
** Precision:
    ** Healthy Loans (0): 1.00
        ** 100% of the loans predicted as healthy are healthy.
    ** High-Risk Loans (1): 0.85
        ** 85% of the loans predicted as high risk are actually high risk. The model is fairly precise in predicting high-risk loans.
** Recall:
    ** Healthy Loans (0): 0.99
        ** 
    ** Unhealthy Loans (1): 0.91
        **


## Summary

I recommend using the logistics regression for the healthy loans because the recall has a perfect score and the support is .99 which is alomst perfect.
